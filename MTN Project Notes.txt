First, start with Overlay mode with no direct link

Device are a random Poisson Point Process

Pr_e of relay being in shadow region, to be computed via simulation

SNR_D2RN,ov1 & SNR_RN2D,ov1 to be calculated during simulation

C_relay,ov1 - transmission capacity to be calculated, and optimized

C_relay,ov1 depends on:
lambda1 - D2D user density
Pr_e - pr of relay in a shadow region
Pr(SIR_D2RN,ov1 >= T2)
Pr(SIR_RN2D,ov1 >= T2)


Make use of NN??
